NOTES: 
	We have a change in position. We need to get the particle to be shot out of the spot position
	at the given angle spread around teh spot and not just from the same direction. The initial velocity
	for each dimension will be calculated using an angle times the initla velocity. Thinking x and z might
	use the same cos angle
