Code Example: Lab08

	This program contains the foundation for creating VAOs and VBOs.
The world is placed in a skybox and already has a default shader implemented.

Usage: 
    Left click and dragging the mouse moves the camera around.

    Ctrl + Left click will zoom the camera in/out.  Scrolling the mouse wheel will
	also zoom in/out.

    The user can also press the 'q' or ESC key to quit the program.

Compilation Instructions:
    Simply navigate to the directory and type 'make.' main.cpp needs
    to be linked with the OpenGL / GLFW / glm / GLEW / SOIL3 libraries.
